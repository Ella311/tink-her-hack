# Blog Space:books::black_nib:
Redefine your boundaries

Our project is a Blogging site which not just provides a wide space for any one to reach out and find their favourite but it also provides a very personalised space for each user. The user, once logged in will be able to get a history of their reading time on the site, their most recently read articles and identify their field of interest as it will be automatically recognised by the system.
Also it provides a free space for any body to write down their minds and aspire and inspire the rising and subsiding matters. :cat:
